<p class="leftpMAIN"> Sports medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with physical fitness and the treatment and prevention of injuries related to sports and exercise. 
Although most sports teams have employed team physicians for many years, it is only since the late 20th century that sports medicine emerged as a distinct field of health care. </p>

<img class="imgleft" src="Messinjure.jpg" width="600px" height="340px">

<p class="rightpMAIN"> Sports medicine can refer to the specific medical specialty or subspecialty of several medical and research disciplines in sports. Sports medicine may be called Sport and Exercise Medicine (SEM), which is now well established in many countries.
 It can broadly also refer to physicians, scientists, trainers, and other paramedical practitioners who work in a broad setting. Sports medicine specialists include a broad range of professions. 
 All sports medicine specialists have one main goal in mind, and that is preventing future injuries and to improve the function of that area to return to everyday life. </p>

<p class="leftpMAIN">
Contrary to popular belief, Sports/Exercise medicine isn't just dealing with phyiscal injuries by rehabbing the injury.
Although tackling injuries consists of a big part of Sports Medicine, it can also include training for overall fitness and mainly training body parts to become
more resistant to injury.
<br><br>
Taking Sports Medicine can let you become an athletic trainer like Tim Grover in the image training Michael Jordan, it can also let you become a physiotherapist,
and a 'strength and conditioning' coach.

<h2 class="lefth2"> TREATMENT: </h2>
<img class="imgleft2" src="AnkleCircle.webp" width="400px" height="400px">

<p class="rightpMAIN2" > These are called ankle circles and are great for when your ankle is still recovering from an ankle sprain.
Ankle sprains are especially common in the Philippines because basketball is the most common sport in the Philippines where many ankle sprains occur.
Ankle circles are so good for recovery for various reasons: you can do it sitting down which is a struggle for people who've sprained an ankle. One of the
main effects of a sprained ankle a lot of swelling of the joint that limits motion, however the only way to 
evacuate swelling out of the joint is through the movement of the ankle signals the lymphatic system 
to pull swelling(namaga) out of the injured area, and gets blood flow to the ankle.
<br><br>
At the start you can usually only move the ankle up and down, start moving the ankle as much as possible within pain-free limits until you can work up to ankle circles
and then work up to being able to walk again </p>

<br><br><br><br>

<h2 class="lefth2"> PREVENTION: </h2>
<img class="imgleft2" src="tibraise.jpg" width="450px" height="260px">
<p class="rightpMAIN2">
 These are (Weighted)Tibialis raises, an exercise that strengthens the ankle and shin muscles to be able to better resist forces and especially injuries
,so that you can be more resistant to ankle sprains. You can do these without weights or with a resistance band. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</p>

<img class="imgright2" src="coolankle.png" width="260px" height="400px">
<div class="bottomborder">
<p class="leftpMAIN">
It is possible to build ankles resistant enough to be nigh-invicible to ankle sprains are shown in the image.
The image also demonstrates another strategy for preventing ankle sprains. It is to practice your ankle being in the compromised position that
an ankle sprain puts you in but in pain-free limits obviously, this makes your ankle more resistant to the injury
 by increasing it's flexibility and strength to adapt to the position. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 class="Centrdh2"> Knee Injuries </h2>

<h2 class="lefth2"> TREATMENT: </h2>
<img class="imgleft2" src="kneerehab.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">

<p class="rightpMAIN2">
Knee injuries are broad and come in various forms like sprains, strains, acl tear, etc. But it is important to have the knee bending (within pain-free limits)
 during rehab like in the image, 
so that the knee can get used to it's natural extension(bending) and go through it's natural range of motion, and to signal the body to adapt and speed up the healing process
whilst directing blood flow to the knee as a result of it moving. 
At the start of more serious knee injuries, bending the knee whilst laying down is more advisable like in glute bridges or leg raises.

<h2 class="lefth2"> PREVENTION: </h2>
<img class="imgleft2" src="AtgSplSq.jpg" width="450px" height="230px">
<p class="rightpMAIN2">
The exercise in the image is called an ATG splitsquat, the exercise is so good for injury prevention because 
it trains the knee through its maximum range of motion whilst applying load to challenge it, you can even apply extra weight
on the exercise through dumbbells to bulletproof and strengthen the knee ligaments even more. Beginners can start from a high box or chair
then slowly
